# Employee-Database-Application-in-Linux
This was a project for my Unix class. It envolved creating a database dummy file, a menu script, an add person script that prevented duplicate and removed temp files, a delete person option, a search script, and a print script. The database holds a person's name, full address, telephone number and email. I also had to create a UML flowchart and pseudocode to be in line with the Software Development Life Cycle. It was a huge learning and eye-opening experience. To make the scripts work you must place them in the same folder then us chmod 777 to allow for execute permissions. You also have to edit your .bash_profile 's PATH variable so the shell knows where to look for commands.
